# My-Spotify-Data-Analysis

As a huge music fan, I am always looking to find new music that I know I will like before I even listen to it. So my goal for this project is to take my Spotify user data and find the certain features from the Spotify API of the songs that I have played the most and find correlation. In addition, I aim to use models to test these relationships between the features of my songs and how much I have played them.

So far, I have used the Spotify API to create a csv file of my listening instances. I cleaned the data and made it more easily digestible for analysis.
